		<p> <h3> Sadly, Izzy passed away this past May, however this is a page in memorium to the best dog in the world. R.I.P Izzaboo. <p>

		<P> Some of her favorite past times included, but were not limited to, rolling in dryer sheets, running on a treadmill, crawling under cars and stealing ice cream cones. <p>

		<p> Just face it... you're jealous of her. <h3> <P>
